<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: December 31, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Day 6 of the Javascript30 challenge. Started solving one Kata on Codewars. Wrote down some ideas for future projects.

**Thoughts** CodeWars is a fantastic way to test your coding skills, while learning new concepts and better ways to write code.

### Day 2: January 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Sketched a website that will help me take note of my daily progress as I study for my university admission test. Requirements: HTML and CSS, Js, one database language (which I'll have to learn for the purpose of this project). Solved a few CodeWars Katas after that.

**Thoughts** I didn't have much time to code as I was busy celebrating the new year, so I mostly did some planning for my future projects.

### Day 3: January 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Went through some Javascript challenges on the freeCodeCamp website and had some real fun trying to solve them.

### Day 4: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Javascript30 challenge and built a HTML5 Canvas that lets you draw a multicoloured line, making some changes over the Javascript30 version.

### Day 5: January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: didn’t have much time to code today, so I followed some lessons from the JavaScript course on the SoloLearn app. Great app + fantastic way to code on the go!

### Day 6: January 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Made a few big improvements to my Solar System game, including a spawn system for every kind of rock. Also, I made the code for future functionalities.

**Thoughts** It feels damn incredible to make some serious progress in a project I deemed too hard for my current level.

### Day 8: January 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Not much today. Started the Web Developer Bootcamp course on Udemy, which looks quite interesting.

### Day 9: January 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Followed a few lessons from the Web Developer Bootcamp, really focusing on the basics again to grasp anything I didn’t quite get at first.

### Day 10: January 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: started working on the rotation of the planets in my Javascript game, Solar System, but I couldn't make it work. I'll try again tomorrow! I also completed a few challenges on freeCodeCamp, which is always a useful resource, and followed some lessons from the HTML section on the Web Developer Bootcamp course.


### Day 11: January 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Followed some lessons on the Web Developer Bootcamp course. 

**Thoughts** I'd really like to get more involved in the coding community.

### Day 12: January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: starting the day with a nice achievement. Finally, my planets can rotate and move freely (although I'll probably change the logics behind it).

### Day 12: January 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Now collision detection with the canvas borders and with the other planets works, even though it isn’t precise.
