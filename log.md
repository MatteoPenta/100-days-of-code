<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: December 31, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Finished Day 6 of the Javascript30 challenge. Started solving one Kata on Codewars. Wrote down some ideas for future projects.

**Thoughts** CodeWars is a fantastic way to test your coding skills, while learning new concepts and better ways to write code.
